- [x] Organise analyses

### Comments

Useful information about the data used in this project can be seen in the `/data` directory. This contains information about which cultivars and species were sequenced, and metadata associated with each one scraped from the national fruit collection website.

Most (if not all) the methods I have used to generate data and any analyses so far can be found in the `/src` directory. This includes web scraping, making HTML docs, fetching data, and other things like variant calling.

Hello to any collaborators; if you wish to discuss/contribute please either email me (mb39 [at] sanger.ac.uk) or raise an issue in this repository!
